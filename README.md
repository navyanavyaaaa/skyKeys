# Sky Keys : A Musical Toy for Toddlers

**Target Age Group:** 2–5 years  

## 🎵 Project Overview

Sky Keys is an interactive musical toy designed to introduce toddlers to the joy of sound and hand-based interaction. Inspired by the Theremin, it uses two upward-facing ultrasonic sensors to allow children to create musical notes by waving their hands in the air. One sensor controls the **note**, and the other adjusts the **octave**, providing a magical, touchless music experience.

The toy is built using **laser-cut MDF**, hand-painted, and decorated with **clay elements** to reflect a vibrant under-the-sea theme. It combines aesthetic design and sound-based feedback to engage toddlers in creative play.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Arduino Uno**
- **Ultrasonic Sensors (HC-SR04)**
- **Buzzer**
- **Laser-cut MDF**
- **Acrylic Paint & Clay for decoration**

## 💡 Interaction Design

- **Sensor 1 (Note Controller):** Measures distance of the hand and maps it to different musical notes.
- **Sensor 2 (Octave Controller):** Adjusts the octave range depending on hand position.
- **Buzzer Output:** Generates the final tone based on note + octave selection.
